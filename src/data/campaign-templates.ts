## Introduction
As a South African business owner or director, understanding your legal obligations under the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) isn't just good practice‚Äîit's essential for protecting yourself from personal liability.

## What is Section 37(2)?
Section 37(2) of the OHSA makes directors and managers personally liable for workplace health and safety violations. This means you could face:
- Personal criminal charges
- Heavy fines
- Imprisonment
- Civil liability for damages

## The Hidden Risks Directors Face
Many business owners don't realize that corporate protection doesn't shield them from OHSA violations. Recent case studies show:
- 67% of prosecuted directors were unaware of their personal liability
- Average fines have increased by 300% in the last 3 years
- Personal assets can be seized to pay damages

      content: `Hi {{firstName}},

Thank you for downloading "The South African Business Owner's Checklist: 5 Steps to OHSA & COIDA Compliance."

**Your checklist is attached** - print it out and keep it handy for quick reference.

But here's something that might surprise you...

Most business owners think their corporate structure protects them from personal liability. Unfortunately, under Section 37(2) of the OHSA, that's not true.

**The Hidden Truth:** Directors and managers can be held personally liable for workplace accidents - even if they weren't directly involved.

Your personal assets, home, and savings could be at risk.

**What's Next?**
1. Review your downloaded checklist
2. Assess your current compliance level
3. Watch for my next email (coming Wednesday) where I'll share a real case study of a Johannesburg director who faced R500,000 in personal liability

Stay protected,

      content: `Hi {{firstName}},

Yesterday I shared your OHSA compliance checklist. Today, I want to tell you about Michael (name changed for privacy).

**Michael's Story:**
- Successful manufacturing company owner in Johannesburg
- 15 years in business, never had a major incident
- Thought his company structure protected him personally

**What Went Wrong:**
A workplace accident occurred. During investigation, authorities found several OHSA compliance gaps. Under Section 37(2), Michael was held personally liable.

**The Cost:**
- R500,000 in personal fines and damages
- 6 months of legal stress
- Nearly lost his family home

**The Lesson:**
Corporate protection doesn't cover OHSA violations. Directors are personally exposed.

**How to Protect Yourself:**
1. Complete the compliance checklist I sent you
2. Conduct regular safety audits
3. Document all safety procedures
4. Get professional guidance

**Need Help?**
If Michael's story concerns you, I'm here to help. Book a 30-minute consultation where we'll review your specific situation and create a protection plan.
