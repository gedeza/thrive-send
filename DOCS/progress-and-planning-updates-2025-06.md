## Major Milestone: Dynamic Campaigns API, Secure Filtering, & Documentation

### Completed Tasks
- Dynamic, filterable `/api/campaigns` API endpoint (secure, scoped, validated; full docs live)

### Components Refactored

- Layout/padding/hydration handling (now consistent)

### In Progress
- **Newsletter/Content Editor**: Advanced features, rich formatting, and media enhancements
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Enhanced metric filtering, chart UI polish

### Next Steps
1. Polish campaigns/new and content/new editor UIs
2. Expand analytics export features
3. Finalize mobile navigation, theme switcher and onboarding docs
4. Integrate content approval workflows

## Technical Debt Addressed

- Up-to-date documentation & audit cycle completed

## Known Issues
