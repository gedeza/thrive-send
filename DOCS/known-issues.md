## Social Media Platform Validation Issue

### Description
The social media platform selection in the content creation wizard is not properly validating platform selection. Despite selecting a platform, the validation still throws an error: "Please select at least one social media platform".

### Location
- `src/components/content/ContentWizard.tsx`
- `src/components/content/EventForm.tsx`

### Current Behavior
1. User can select social media platforms
2. The selection appears to be visually registered (UI updates)
3. However, when proceeding to the next step or submitting, validation fails
4. Error message: "Please select at least one social media platform"

### Technical Details
- Issue appears to be related to state management between `selectedPlatforms` and `formData.socialMediaContent.platforms`
- The validation in `handleComplete` function is not receiving the correct platform data
- Debug logs show inconsistency between selected platforms and form data

### Impact
- Users cannot create social media content
- Other content types (blog, article, email) work correctly
- This is blocking the social media content creation feature

### Temporary Workaround
Users can create other types of content while this issue is being resolved.

### Priority
Medium - This is a core feature but not blocking other functionality

### Next Steps
1. Review state management implementation
2. Add more comprehensive logging
3. Consider refactoring the platform selection logic
4. Implement proper state synchronization between components

### Notes
- This issue was discovered during the initial implementation of the content creation wizard
- The problem seems to be in the state synchronization between the form and wizard components
- A potential solution might involve consolidating the platform selection state management
