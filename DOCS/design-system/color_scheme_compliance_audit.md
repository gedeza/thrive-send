## Status Table

| Area                                    | Status        | Notes                                                             |
|------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Use of semantic color tokens             | **Partial**   | Some legacy/default classes or raw hex may still be in use.        |
| Button color states (primary/success/etc)| **Partial**   | Confirm use of proper custom classes, not Tailwind defaults.       |
| Light/Dark mode switching                | **OK**        | Supported via Tailwind, but review per component.                  |
| Gradients/backgrounds                    | **OK**        | No major issues found.                                             |
| Customization of ShadCN UI components    | **Requires check** | Ensure all use approved color tokens/classes.                 |
| Use of custom white/black text classes   | **Requires check** | Replace `text-white`/`text-black` with project classes.       |

## Identified Issues

- At least one noted discrepancy: _"Color scheme not fully consistent with 'colour_scheme.md'."_ (see `task_doc_reconciliation.json`)
- Tailwind upgrade may require audit of all `.text-white`, `.text-black`, or raw hex codes in use.

---

## Recommendations & Next Steps

1. **Full audit of all UI components and screens.**
2. **Replace legacy/hex values** with semantic tokens from [`colour_scheme.md`].
3. **Enforce usage of custom classes** (`text-custom-white`, etc.) per new Tailwind guidelines.
4. **Regularly review** this audit after significant code merges or design changes.
5. **Update the task reconciliation tracker** with any newly identified discrepancies and resolution status.
6. **Assign owners for each fix/update** and track completion in project management system.
