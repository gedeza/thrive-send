## Implementation Approach Review

Core development principles continue to serve the project well:

1. Feature-first, user-focused implementations
2. Consistent documentation and technical specifications
3. Regular task reconciliation and progress tracking
4. Clean architecture and component organization

The project is on track to reach feature-complete status in the near term, with the focus now on real data integration, polishing user experiences, and enhancing documentation.
