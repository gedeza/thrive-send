# Project Progress Update - 2024-06-09

## Milestone Achievement: Core UI Refactoring & Authentication

### Completed Tasks
- Implemented canonical sidebar navigation across the application
- Refactored component structure for consistent styling and behavior
- Standardized form components for better reusability
- Improved responsive design across dashboard views
- Implemented and stabilized Clerk authentication (now production-ready)
- Fixed Next.js hydration error by standardizing `<body className="">` across layouts
- Registered Chart.js Filler plugin; resolved analytics area chart warning

### Components Refactored
- Dashboard layout components
- Navigation components
- Form input components 
- Status indicators
- UI utility components
- Auth-protected dashboard components
- Analytics widgets (including line/area charts)
- Layout components (hydration, class consistency)

### In Progress
- **Campaign Creation**: Basic structure implemented, content editor integration pending
- **Content Management**: Basic form structure implemented, rich text editor and media management to be completed
- **Analytics Dashboard**: More metrics/charts and UX polish in development

### Next Steps
1. Complete the campaigns/new page with content editor integration
2. Finish the content/new page with media upload functionality
3. Connect both pages to the backend API
4. Implement form validation and error handling
5. Add tests for new components
6. Finalize mobile navigation and theme switcher
7. Grow onboarding docs for new contributors and users
8. Complete analytics dashboard and export features

## Technical Debt Addressed
- Removed duplicate dashboard components
- Standardized naming conventions across the codebase
- Improved component props typing
- Enhanced error handling patterns
- Chart.js/Next.js warnings removed
- UI color compliance started; remaining legacy/hex code to be refactored
- Documentation audit completed and new progress snapshot generated

## Known Issues
- Media upload progress indicator needs refinement
- Form validation needs to be made consistent across all forms
- Some responsive design issues on smaller viewports
- UI color audit and legacy code review still in progress
- Form validation, edge-case error handling, and onboarding flows need more coverage
