## Motivation

We've made solid foundational progress! While we estimate the project at about **40% complete**, much of the complex and user-facing functionality still lies ahead‚Äîincluding authentication, content creation flows, and polishing mobile experience. With the groundwork done, future sprints should accelerate visible progress and user feature delivery.
