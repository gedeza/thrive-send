# 📋 ThriveSend PRD Compliance Progress Tracker

## Document Information
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Date**: January 2025
- **Purpose**: Track systematic PRD compliance across entire application
- **Business Model**: B2B2G Service Provider Platform
- **Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Dashboard Integration

---

## 🎯 **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

### **The Challenge**
ThriveSend application has a **massive PRD compliance gap**:
- ✅ **Correct ServiceProviderDashboard** implemented (PRD-compliant)
- ❌ **Wrong legacy dashboard** currently being served
- ❌ **Entire application** needs systematic PRD compliance audit

### **The Solution: Systematic PRD Compliance Methodology**
A phased approach to achieve **100% PRD compliance** across all components:

1. **Fix Critical Issues** (ServiceProviderDashboard integration)
2. **Audit All Components** against PRD requirements  
3. **Update/Rebuild Non-Compliant Components**
4. **Test & Validate** each implementation
5. **Repeat** until entire application is PRD-compliant

---

## 🔄 **METHODOLOGY: Systematic PRD Compliance Process**

### **Phase Template (Repeat for Each Component)**
```
1. AUDIT: Compare component vs PRD requirements
2. ANALYZE: Identify inconsistencies and gaps
3. DESIGN: Create/correct TDD based on PRD
4. IMPLEMENT: Build PRD-compliant component
5. INTEGRATE: Replace inconsistent component
6. TEST: Validate functionality and PRD compliance
7. DOCUMENT: Update progress and move to next component
```
