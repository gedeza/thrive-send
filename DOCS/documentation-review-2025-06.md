- Synced all remaining work and future features across the three main planning/progress docs.
- Confirmed all process/canonical references and doc links are accurate or point to stubs if awaiting final content.

## Next Steps

- Continue the standard doc review after every major sprint or architectural milestone.
- Run script-based link and duplication checks as standard after big merges.
