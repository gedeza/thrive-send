# ThriveSend Project Reset Plan

Given the recurring issues with component implementation and structural problems, here's a systematic plan to get the project back on track.

## Phase 1: Project Structure Cleanup

1. **Create a fresh branch** from your current state to experiment safely:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fresh-start
   ```

2. **Ensure all required dependencies are installed**:
   ```bash
   pnpm add react-error-boundary class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge lucide-react @radix-ui/react-slot tailwindcss-animate
   ```

3. **Fix the project structure**:
   - Make sure all component files are in the correct directories
   - Remove any malformed files with syntax errors
   - Ensure all imports use consistent patterns

## Phase 2: Core Component Implementation

Implement the UI components one by one, testing each one before moving to the next:

1. **Button** - The foundation of interactive elements
2. **Card** - Container for content sections
3. **Dropdown Menu** - For navigation and user actions
4. **Tabs** - For content organization

## Phase 3: Layout Components

Implement the layout components that structure the application:

1. **Header** - Top navigation and user actions
2. **Sidebar** - Side navigation
3. **MainLayout** - Combines header, sidebar and content area

## Phase 4: Feature Components

Implement the feature-specific components:

1. **Analytics** components
2. **Content** components
3. **User** components

## Best Practices to Avoid Issues

1. **Always manually review code** before pasting it into files
2. **Remove any artifact markup** (`
