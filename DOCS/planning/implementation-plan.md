## Notable Implementation Changes (Sync with Progress)

- **Mobile Navigation:**  
  Slide-out menu with animation, backdrop, hamburger toggle fully integrated for all small screens.  
- **Content Calendar:**  
  Full workflow: create, schedule (date/time), drag-and-drop reschedule, preview modal, filter/view switch.
- **Analytics Dashboard:**
  UI foundation with chart components and mock data completed, API and database integration in progress.
- **Sidebar & Layout:**  
  Single source of truth, highly responsive, all padding/spacing handled by layout.
- **UI Components:**
  Missing UI components (date-picker-range, skeleton, toast) implemented, Button component updated with buttonVariants function.

## Next Priorities & Phasing

### Phase 3/4 – In Progress / Up Next
- Connect analytics dashboard to real data via API and database
- Complete rich text/newsletter advanced editor
- Media library polish & upload
- Content approval & status flows
- Analytics export functionality

### Final MVP Push
- User management polish, onboarding
- Settings, integration, notification pages
- Theme system and accessibility
- Expanded documentation, test coverage

## Amended App Directory Structure (`/src/app`)

> _The legacy `/pages` router is removed—this is the current Next.js app-based structure (as of latest implementation)._

```
src/app/
├── _auth_backup/
│   └── (auth)/
├── (dashboard)/
│   ├── analytics/
│   ├── calendar/
│   ├── campaigns/
│   ├── clients/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── content-library/
│   ├── dashboard/
│   ├── demo/
│   ├── page.tsx
│   ├── projects/
│   ├── settings/
│   └── templates/
├── error.tsx
├── favicon.ico
├── globals.css
├── landing/
│   └── page.tsx
└── page.tsx
```

- `src/app/(dashboard)/` holds all authenticated app/dashboard views and main modules.
- `src/app/landing/` is for the public landing page.
- `page.tsx` files define routed page components directly within the app folder.
- `error.tsx`, `favicon.ico`, and `globals.css` are top-level configs and assets.
- There is no `pages/` router—**all routes are handled by Next.js App Router (`/src/app`) for modular, future-ready applications**.
