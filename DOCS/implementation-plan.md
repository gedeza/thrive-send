## Key Real-World Implementation Changes & Optimizations

- **Legacy `/pages` Route Dropped:**  
  Migrated to Next.js App Router (`/src/app`) for modern layout/route conventions and better performance.
- **Sidebar & Layout Refactor:**  
  Collapsed duplicate sidebars and layouts into a single source-of-truth with responsive, path-based behavior.  
- **Component De-duplication:**  
  Centralized shared UI components to avoid code drift and improve maintainability.
- **Test & Build Optimization:**  
  CI pipeline streamlined; tests and builds updated for new folder structure and removed redundant checks.
- **Media Handling/Upload Tweaks:**  
  Base upload/forms stable; further asynchronous feedback (progress bars, error handling) in progress.
- **Feature Prioritization by Feedback:**  
  Some PRD features moved up/down the roadmap based on user/stakeholder input for real deliverability.

## Amended App Directory Structure (`/src/app`)

> _The legacy `/pages` router is removed—this is the current Next.js app-based structure (as of latest implementation)._

```
src/app/
├── _auth_backup/
│   └── (auth)/
├── (dashboard)/
│   ├── analytics/
│   ├── calendar/
│   ├── campaigns/
│   ├── clients/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── content-library/
│   ├── dashboard/
│   ├── demo/
│   ├── page.tsx
│   ├── projects/
│   ├── settings/
│   └── templates/
├── error.tsx
├── favicon.ico
├── globals.css
├── landing/
│   └── page.tsx
└── page.tsx
```

- `src/app/(dashboard)/` holds all authenticated app/dashboard views and main modules.
- `src/app/landing/` is for the public landing page.
- `page.tsx` files define routed page components directly within the app folder.
- `error.tsx`, `favicon.ico`, and `globals.css` are top-level configs and assets.
- There is no `pages/` router—**all routes are handled by Next.js App Router (`/src/app`) for modular, future-ready applications**.

## Implementation Approach (Mapped to PRD 8.1, 9.1, 9.3)

For each phase:
1. **Define specific user stories and acceptance criteria**  ✔️
2. **Create wireframes/mockups for UI components**  ✔️
3. **Implement backend APIs and database models**  ✔️ / ⏳
4. **Develop frontend components and pages**  ✔️ / ⏳
5. **Write tests (unit, integration)**  ⏳ (test coverage climbing, core flows prioritized)
6. **Document features and usage**  ⏳ (documentation progress strong, ongoing)
