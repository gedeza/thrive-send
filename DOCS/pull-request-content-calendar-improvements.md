# Content Calendar Component Improvements

## Summary

This PR addresses several critical issues with the Content Calendar component, focusing on robust error handling, database connection resilience, and consistent mock data strategy. The improvements ensure that the application remains functional even when the database is unavailable, providing a seamless user experience with clear feedback.

## Changes

### Key Improvements:

1. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Added comprehensive error handling across all API calls
   - Implemented graceful fallback mechanism for database connection issues
   - Enhanced error logging for debugging

2. **Mock Data Strategy**
   - Created a centralized mock data provider (`calendar-service.ts`)
   - Added helper functions for all CRUD operations with consistent mock data
   - Implemented automatic switching to mock data when needed

3. **API Resilience**
   - Enhanced API routes to handle database connection issues
   - Added better error reporting and status indicators
   - Implemented standard error response format

4. **UI Enhancements**
   - Added visual indicators when using mock data
   - Improved loading and error states
   - Provided better user feedback during operation failures

### Files Changed:

- `/src/app/api/calendar/events/route.ts` - Added robust error handling and mock data fallback
- `/src/lib/mock/calendar-service.ts` - Created a comprehensive mock data provider
- `/src/lib/api/calendar-service.ts` - Improved API service with fallback mechanisms
- `/DOCS/content-calendar-improvements.md` - Added detailed documentation

## Testing

The changes have been tested under various conditions:

1. **Normal Operation** - Verified all CRUD operations with database connection
2. **Database Unavailable** - Confirmed graceful fallback to mock data
3. **Network Issues** - Tested timeout and connection error handling
4. **Recovery** - Validated the system returns to normal when database becomes available
