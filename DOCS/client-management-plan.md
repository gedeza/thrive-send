# Client Management Implementation Plan

## Overview
The client management system will allow ThriveSend users to create, view, edit, and delete client profiles. Each client can have multiple social media accounts and projects associated with them.

## Data Model
We'll use the existing Prisma schema with the `Client` model:

```prisma
model Client {
  id                String              @id @default(cuid())
  name              String
  type              ClientType
  industry          String?
  logoUrl           String?
  website           String?
  createdAt         DateTime            @default(now())
  updatedAt         DateTime            @updatedAt
  
  // Relations
  organization      Organization        @relation(fields: [organizationId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  organizationId    String
  socialAccounts    SocialAccount[]
  projects          Project[]
  analytics         Analytics[]
}
```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create Client List Page
- Display a table of all clients
- Include sorting and filtering options
- Show key information: name, type, industry, number of projects, etc.

### 2. Create Client Detail Page
- Overview section with client details
- Tabs for:
  - Projects
  - Social Accounts
  - Analytics
  - Settings

### 3. Create Client Form
- Form for adding new clients
- Form for editing existing clients
- Validation and error handling

### 4. Implement Client API Routes
- GET /api/clients - List all clients
- GET /api/clients/:id - Get a specific client
- POST /api/clients - Create a new client
- PUT /api/clients/:id - Update a client
- DELETE /api/clients/:id - Delete a client

### 5. Client Dashboard Widget

- Show recent client activity
