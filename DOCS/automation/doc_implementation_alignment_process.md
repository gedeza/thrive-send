# Documentation & Implementation Alignment Process

## Purpose
To ensure that the implementation closely follows documentation, minimizing missed requirements and facilitating smooth delivery.

---

## Review Cadence
- **Frequency:** Weekly or after significant project milestones.
- **Participants:** Dev team, product owner, relevant stakeholders.

---

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Prepare Artifacts**
   - Update the `task_doc_reconciliation.json` file with the latest tasks, status, and doc refs.
   - Gather links to relevant PRs, source files, and documentation entries.

2. **Run the Task Reconciliation**
   - For each major task:
     - Cross-check implementation details vs. documentation specs.
     - Update `implemented_in`, `notes`, and `discrepancies` fields in the JSON.

3. **Review Discrepancies**
   - Collate all flagged discrepancies (see `discrepancy_summary`) for group review.
   - Assign owners and timelines for resolution.

4. **Decision and Action Items**
   - Decide how to resolve mismatches.
   - Update documentation or refactor code as necessary.
   - Set a `next_review_due` date.

5. **Archive Old Reviews**
   - Preserve previous versions of the JSON or export summaries for audit/history.

---

## Templates

- **JSON Tracker:** Use `/DOCS/task_doc_reconciliation.json`
- **Actions Register:** Maintain or link action items for each review.

---

## Best Practices

- Keep tasks granular and clearly mapped to documentation.
- Record every discrepancy, even minor ones, for traceability.
- Use review findings to continuously improve documentation and process.
