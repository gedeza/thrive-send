## ðŸŽ¨ Design Tokens & Color Scheme

ThriveSend enforces a centralized, token-based color system for all UI development.

- All UI colors must be referenced via semantic tokens defined in [`colour_scheme.md`](DOCS/colour_scheme.md).
- Raw hex codes, `text-white`/`text-black`, and generic Tailwind color classes are strictly prohibited in production code.
- All UI contributions must pass the [color scheme compliance audit](DOCS/color_scheme_compliance_audit.md) before merging.
- This ensures brand consistency, robust dark/light support, rapid theme changes, and easy maintainability.

...

## Technology Stack
- **Design Tokens:** Strict, semantic token-based system ([`colour_scheme.md`](DOCS/colour_scheme.md))
- **Authentication:** Clerk (see `DOCS/guides/clerk-setup-guide.md` for full integration steps)

## Development Guidelines
  - **Centralized Color Scheme:**  
  - All UI colors are now managed as semantic tokens in [`colour_scheme.md`](colour_scheme.md). No more raw hex/Tailwind overrides; design consistency enforced by audit.
  - Tailwind & UI Library Integration: Core theme and light/dark support are centralized and easy to maintain.
  - Color Audit and Enforcement: All new and updated code passes the [color scheme compliance audit](color_scheme_compliance_audit.md).
  - Documentation: README and design/implementation specs updated to reflect the color policy and compliance process.
  - Only reference colors via semantic tokens in [`colour_scheme.md`](DOCS/colour_scheme.md).
  - No raw hex, `text-white`, `text-black`, or Tailwind default classes in application code.
  - Every UI PR must pass the [color scheme compliance audit](DOCS/color_scheme_compliance_audit.md).

## Prototypes & Demos

The `Prototypes` directory contains experimental implementations and isolated demo components for visualization, UI concepts, or integration feasibility studies. These are intended for internal development reference and are not part of the production application.

### ChartjsTwoToneBarDemo

- **File:** `Prototypes/ChartjsTwoToneBarDemo.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Demonstrates the use of Chart.js and `react-chartjs-2` for advanced chart rendering in React.
    - Features two bar charts: a vertical bar for Monthly UVs and a horizontal bar for Feature Usage, each with two-tone alternating color schemes.
- **Dependencies:**
    - `chart.js`
    - `react-chartjs-2`
- **Usage:**  
    Import and use `<ChartjsTwoToneBarDemo />` in any React component/page for a showcase of customizable chart components.
- **Customization:**  
    - Easily adjust color schemes by modifying the `BLUE` and `GREEN` constants in the component.
    - Update data arrays to visualize different datasets.
- See inline file documentation for further details.

**Note:**  
Prototypes are provided to speed up UI research and are not guaranteed to align with all design token restrictions, linting standards, or code review policies applicable to the `/src` production code. Use them as references or starting points for new feature work.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`
3. Set up environment variables for Neon database and Clerk authentication (see [`clerk-setup-guide.md`](DOCS/guides/clerk-setup-guide.md))
4. Run the development server with `pnpm dev`
5. Build for production with `pnpm build`

> **Note:** The platform standardizes on Clerk for authentication. If you find references to BetterAuth or Supabase in older documentation, treat those as outdated.

## Development Guidelines

- **App Router Architecture**: Utilize Next.js App Router for improved routing and layouts
- **Server Components**: Use React Server Components for data-fetching and static content
- **Client Components**: Apply 'use client' directive only for interactive elements
- **TypeScript**: Maintain strict TypeScript typing throughout the codebase
- **Memory Bank**: Document architectural decisions and implementations in the memory bank
- **Component Structure**: Follow the established component organization
- Implement responsive design for all screen sizes
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
- Write unit tests for critical functionality

## Deployment

The platform can be deployed to Vercel with the following steps:

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure environment variables for production
3. Deploy the application
4. Set up custom domain if needed

## Business Model

ThriveSend follows a B2B2G model where:

1. ThriveSend (platform) sells to businesses and service providers
