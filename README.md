## Enhanced Minimalist Design System

ThriveSend implements a performance-optimized design system that achieves professional polish while maintaining fast load times and optimal user experience.

### Quick Implementation Guide

#### For New Components
```jsx
// Use enhanced card system
<Card className="card-enhanced border-l-2 border-primary/20 bg-card">
  <CardContent className="p-4">
    <div className="p-3 bg-primary/10 rounded-lg border border-primary/20">
      <Icon className="h-6 w-6 text-primary" />
    </div>
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

#### Available Classes
- **Cards**: `card-enhanced`, `card-accent`
- **Borders**: `border-enhanced`, `border-accent`, `border-subtle`
- **Shadows**: `shadow-enhanced`, `shadow-professional`
- **Colors**: `primary`, `success`, `muted`, `destructive` (maximum 4 semantic)

#### Key Principles
- ✅ **Performance First**: No gradients, optimized shadows
- ✅ **Professional Polish**: Clear borders, consistent elevation
- ✅ **Typography Hierarchy**: Information structure through fonts, not colors
- ✅ **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliant, color-independent navigation

### Implementation Rules
1. All new cards MUST use `card-enhanced` class
2. Icon containers MUST use `bg-{color}/10 border border-{color}/20`
3. Hover states MUST use `hover:shadow-professional transition-shadow duration-200`
4. Border accents MUST use `border-l-2 border-{semantic}/20`
