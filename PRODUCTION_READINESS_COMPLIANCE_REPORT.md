## Deployment Recommendation

### **Current Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION**

Despite substantial progress (75-80% completion), **critical data integrity issues** prevent safe production deployment:

1. **Mock business data** could mislead users about actual performance
2. **Demo client references** compromise multi-tenant security
3. **Reports functionality** completely non-operational with real data

### **Beta Deployment Recommendation: ‚úÖ READY WITH CAVEATS**

The platform could support **limited beta testing** with these restrictions:
- Disable reports dashboard until real data integration
- Add warning banners about mock campaign performance data
- Limit to single-tenant testing to avoid demo client exposure

### **Production Deployment Timeline**

- **Optimistic**: 3-5 days (if critical issues resolved immediately)
- **Realistic**: 1-2 weeks (including testing and validation)
- **Conservative**: 2-3 weeks (if additional issues discovered)
